              "pk" aka primary key
              Because we didn't specify a primary key in our Post model,
              Django creates one for us (by default, a field named "id"
              holding a number that increases for each record, i.e. 1, 2, 3)
              and adds it as a field to each of our posts. We access the
              primary key by writing post.pk, the same way we access other
              fields (title, author, etc.) in our Post object
            -->
              <a href="{% url 'post_detail' pk=post.pk %}">
